Q.Find Customer Referee
referee_id <> 2  this will not show the null value rows so use explicityly referee_id IS NULL or refree_id <> 2
or we can do IFNULL(refree_id, -1) <> 2 
if you have multiple columns to check for null COALESCE(referee_id, referee_num, -1) <> 2
Coalesce returns the first non-null value in a list. If all the values in the list are NULL, then the function returns null.
